# SHAP Multilingual Sentiment Analysis

This project implements multilingual sentiment analysis using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability. It analyzes sentiment in parallel texts across multiple languages (English, Russian, and Italian) and provides detailed visualizations of how each **word** contributes to the sentiment predictions.

## Features

- Multilingual sentiment analysis using DistilBERT-based model
- SHAP-based model interpretation
- Custom and built-in SHAP visualizations
- Support for parallel multillingual text analysis
- Word-level contribution analysis
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly

Originally created on: Windows 11 (64-bit), NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, VS Code

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd SHAP_project
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Format

The project include two datasets:

1. `movie.csv` - Movie parallel subtitles dataset with columns:
   - id
   - english
   - russian
   - italian

Custom dataset is created on the basis of [ParTree - Parallel Treebanks: A multilingual corpus of movie subtitles](https://www.swissubase.ch/en/catalogue/studies/20295/latest/datasets/2253/2582/overview). 

2. `ai_act.csv` - Legal text dataset with columns:
   - id
   - article (â„– of article in original document)
   - english
   - italian

Custom dataset is created on the basis of official AI Act documents in Italian and English [available on EUR-LEX](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R1689). 

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook shap_clean.ipynb
```

2. Run the cells in sequence to:
   - Load and process the datasets
   - Generate classic token-level SHAP explanations
   - Generate word-level SHAP explanations
   - Create visualizations

## Visualizations

The project provides two types of visualizations:

1. Custom Interactive Visualization (Plotly-based)
   - Color-coded word importance
   - Interactive tooltips
   - Sentiment-specific coloring

2. SHAP Force Plot
   - Shows cumulative feature impact
   - Base value to prediction flow

## Output Files

- `simple_movie.json`: Processed movie subtitle analysis
- `simple_legal.json`: Processed legal text analysis
- `shap_logs/`: Directory containing detailed processing logs

## Notes

- CUDA support is recommended for optimal performance
